# Repository structure

Status: accepted for Milestone 1 (2026-07-16)

The engine is a Rust workspace. Protocol and package schemas remain language
neutral. Native and adapter code live beside the engine without being coupled to
its release cadence.

Only `autophagy-events` exists in PR 1. A crate or package is added when its PR
contains an executable vertical slice; empty placeholder crates are avoided.

## Dependency direction

```text
adapters -> events -> store -> retrieval -> patterns -> digest
                    \                         /
                     +------ core -----------+
                              |
                    cli / daemon / MCP / macOS
```

`autophagy-events` has no dependency on storage, models, adapters, or UI.
Storage accepts validated events and owns transactionality and idempotency.
Detectors consume query interfaces rather than SQLite connections. Model-backed
synthesis is downstream of deterministic pattern discovery.

## Versioning boundaries

- AEP versions serialized events independently of crate versions.
- SQLite uses ordered, immutable migrations and a schema version table.
- Mutation packages declare their own format version and semantic version.
- CLI and local IPC responses are versioned before external integrations depend
  on them.
