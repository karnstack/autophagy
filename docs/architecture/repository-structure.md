# Repository structure

Status: accepted for Milestone 1 (2026-07-16)

The engine is a Rust workspace. Protocol and package schemas remain language
neutral. Native and adapter code live beside the engine without being coupled to
its release cadence.

`autophagy-events`, `autophagy-store`, `autophagy-core`, `autophagy-cli`, the
native Claude Code and Codex adapters, and their shared conformance harness
exist through PR 5. `autophagy-patterns` and Evidence Packet v0.1 exist through
PR 6. `autophagy-redaction` and the offline digestion/privacy CLI complete
Milestone 1 through PR 7. `autophagy-mutations` begins Phase 2 with the
review-only Mutation Package v0.1 contract, while `autophagy-store` owns the
immutable candidate registry, evidence links, lifecycle audit, and replay
reports. `autophagy-replay` adds versioned annotated decision points and
deterministic non-executable evaluation. A crate or package is added when its PR
contains an executable vertical slice; empty placeholder crates are avoided.

## Dependency direction

```text
adapters -> events -> store -> retrieval -> patterns -> digest
                    \                         /
                     +------ core -----------+
                              |
                    cli / daemon / MCP / macOS
```

`autophagy-events` has no dependency on storage, models, adapters, or UI.
Storage accepts validated events and owns transactionality and idempotency.
Detectors consume query interfaces rather than SQLite connections. Model-backed
synthesis is downstream of deterministic pattern discovery.

## Versioning boundaries

- AEP versions serialized events independently of crate versions.
- SQLite uses ordered, immutable migrations and a schema version table.
- Mutation packages declare their own format version and semantic version.
- CLI and local IPC responses are versioned before external integrations depend
  on them.
